  $is_local_url = strpos( home_url(), '.test' ) || strpos( home_url(), '.local' );
  $is_local     = $is_local_env || $is_local_url;

  if ( $is_local && file_exists( __DIR__ . '/dist/fast-refresh.php' ) ) {
  	require_once __DIR__ . '/dist/fast-refresh.php';
  	TenUpToolkit\set_dist_url_path( basename( __DIR__ ), TENUP_THEME_DIST_URL, TENUP_THEME_DIST_PATH );
  }
